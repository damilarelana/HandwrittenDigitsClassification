### simpleDigitsClassification

A classification algorithm applies scikit-learn to the problem of `optical character recognition` of hand-written numerical digits. The code focuses on identifying the numerical character in the image, without attempting to locate the image itself. As such, the test/validation `data` comes from scikit-learn's set of pre-formmatted digits.

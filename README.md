### simpleDigitsClassification

This applies scikit-learn to the problem of `optical character recognition` of hand-written numerical digits. The code would identify the character in the image [i.e. classification problem]. We are not exploring the option of locating the image itself [i.e. a tracking problem]. The `data` would come from scikit-learn's set of pre-formmatted digits.
